# Week 1 Challenge - Semantic Tags

This project challenge is an on-the-job ticket that included starter code that needed to be modified. One of the most common tasks for front-end developers and junior developers is to take exisiting code and refactor it to meet a certain set of standards or implement a new technology. In this challenge, a marketing agency has hired me to refactor an existing site to make it more accessible.

## Horiseon Demo

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:

> **Note**: This layout is designed for desktop viewing, so you may notice that some of the elements don't look like the mock-up at a resolution smaller than 768px.
